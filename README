QUICKDEV2 NOTES

20100808

AVR ISP
o quickdev standart cable that has isp asn serial 
o connect avr dragon isp to isp header at combo cable
o avr dragon isp
    o vcc has to be connected
    o red: vcc
    o black: gnd
    o sck: yellow
    o mosi: green
    o rst: black
o runs under os x

AVR JTAG:
o connects to the xilinx jtag cable
o AVR ISP has to be disconnected
o jtag header
    o vcc: red
    o gnd: black
    o tdi: yellow
    o tdo: green
    o tms: white
    o sck: red
o last test on linux and osx wir avarice (2.09,2.10) didn't work, starting up a 
  gdb yields and 'cant access memory' error
  

CPLD JTAG:
o runs under linx in vmware
o preload usbdriver
o export LD_PRELOAD=/home/david/Devel/arch/fpga/tools/usb-driver
o check usb vendor id, has to be 03fd:0008
o otherwise fxload the firmware by hand
o start impact, it should find the cable automatically, if not reboot
o the cpld gets dedecteted by it self, if not run boundairy scan
o run 'program' from context menu

QUICKDEV DEBUG HEADER
o then head pins located at the reset button
o connect to saleae LA:
    gnd:    grey
    debug0: black
    debug1: brown
    debug2: red
    debug3: orange
    debug4: yellow
    debug5: green
    debug6: blue
    debug7: lila
    

POC MASSSTORAGE
o makefile include 'programm' for avrdude with dragon_isp
o uart uses the quickdev combo cabel and runs at 115200
o compile works under os x
o seriall screen works under os x
o os x see masstorage device


POC SREG
o makefile include 'programm' for avrdude with dragon_isp
o uart uses the quickdev combo cabel and runs at 115200
o compile works under os x
o seriall screen works under os x
o to debug the sreg or the fsm reduce the speed of the avr
    o program fuse divide clock by 8 internally
    o set uart baud speed to 9600 by setting UBRR1=25
    o change speed in screen session
